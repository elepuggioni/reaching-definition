# Reaching Definition and Available Expression analysis

This is a university group project created by @andredore, @elepuggioni and another colleague for our Linguaggi di Programmazione (Programming Languages) course.

This program performs a Reaching Definitions Analysis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaching_definition) and Available Expressions Analysis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Available_expression) on a given expression written in a mock programming language called IMP.
